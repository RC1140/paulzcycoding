The SSL MITM Lab
Directions to Students

Your goal is to modify your copy of sslattack.c so that when your
program detects a dns request for a target website (e.g. paypal.com)
it responds with a spoofed response with a webserver of your
choosing.  Please see the attack writeup for further information.
